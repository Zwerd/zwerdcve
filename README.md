🔎 About This Repository
This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my ongoing journey into the depths of Vulnerability Research (VR) and Exploit Development. Drawing on over 16 years of experience in the technological landscape and my background as a Cyber Researcher, this project bridges the gap between theoretical vulnerability descriptions and practical, executable exploitation.

The primary goal here is not merely to reproduce known exploits, but to dissect them. For each CVE listed, I strive to perform a complete research cycle:

Vulnerability Analysis: Understanding the root cause (RCA) – whether it be memory corruption, logic errors, or race conditions.

Environment Reproduction: Setting up vulnerable labs (often involving kernel-level debugging or hardened Linux environments).

Exploit Engineering: Developing custom PoCs, typically moving from a Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Local Privilege Escalation (LPE).

Mitigation Research: Analyzing how modern security mechanisms (SELinux, AppArmor, ASLR/DEP) interact with the vulnerability.

🛠️ Methodology & Technical Focus
My research focuses heavily on understanding the "Why" and "How" behind a crash. The content here reflects a rigor demanded by advanced certification standards and real-world threat simulation.

Key Areas of Interest:
Memory Corruption: Stack/Heap Overflows, Use-After-Free (UAF), and Format String vulnerabilities.

Linux Internals: Kernel exploitation, driver analysis, and bypassing user-space mitigations.

Reverse Engineering: Static and dynamic analysis using tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, and GDB (pwndbg/gef).

Post-Exploitation: Crafting stable shellcode and understanding execution flow hijacking.

📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by CVE ID, with each directory typically containing:

exploit.py / exploit.c: The raw exploit code developed or modified during research.

analysis.md: A detailed technical write-up explaining the vulnerability triggers, memory layout, and exploitation strategy.

vulnerable_setup/: Dockerfiles or scripts to spin up the specific vulnerable environment for testing.
